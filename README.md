# CSS487-RockPaperScissors
In this interactive Rock, Paper, Scissors program, the user takes a photograph of their hand gesture, which will be one of the following: rock, paper, or scissors. The program, using computer vision and OpenCV methods, identifies the player’s choice. The program also randomly selects its move from the three options. The winner of the game is then determined by comparing the player’s choice and the program’s choice, following the traditional rules of the game. The user can use the webcam or provide an image of their own (NOTE, if doing the latter and running on a batch file, be sure to include an image as an argument in the batch command).
